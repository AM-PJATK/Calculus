Calculus (AM) - internet based studies 

2023/2024 letni

The lecture provides basic ideas on mathematical analysis including functions of one real variable, sequences, series and power series. It also covers notions of limits of a function, continuity of a function, its derivative and applications of these notions (checking for extrema, intermediate-value theorem, mean-value theorem, L'Hospital's rule, Taylor series). The integral, the definite integral are also covered in the course.

Main concepts of differential and integral calculus of functions of several variables as well as their applications are also discussed.

The rules are given in the "Announcement" section.

I submitted the proposed tutorial grades. I want to remind you that this proposition will be your tutorial grade 
only if You get at least 5 points (out of 30 points)  on the exam (only one trial). 
Otherwise the proposition of the grade is not valid and your tutorial grade is 2.

NOTE for homework 2: some people used de l'Hospital's rule. Derivatives will be in the next lectures. You should use methods from the current or previous lectures, not future ones.

I would like to remind you that the homework should be formatted as one PDF file!!! This time I checked them, next homeworks other than PDF will not be checked. The correct solutions are in the Materials, please look at the methods, not only the results. You can have a good result and a bad solution.

EXAM - rules

• You can have a handwritten  “formula sheet” of size A4 ( may be written on both sides). You cannot put any solved tasks on the formula sheet.

• The solutions are graded on the basis of correct reasoning, proper notation and clarity. That is why, the solutions should be presented step-by-step. The solution without any explanations is graded 0 points.

• No electronic devices (calculators, mobile phones etc.) textbooks, exercise books or any other medium with solved problems are allowed in the exam.

• The test can be verified orally, without giving any explanation.

Dear Students. My name is Artur Bryk. I would like to write some words about organisation of the course.

The homework should be done until Sunday 23:59 (every 2 weeks). You can find it in "Materials" section. The deadlines for each homework You can find in "Calendar" section.

You can find a folder for each homework in the "Tasks" section , so don't send it by e-mail, just upload it there.

The homeworks must be in  PDF format (one file) 

You can get 4 points for each homework. There will be 8 homeworks. Amount of points required to be able to write the examination is 16.

You can get 30 points on the exam. You need at least 15 points to pass. 

You can always contact me by e-mail: abryk@pjwstk.edu.pl, so don't hesitate to write if You have got any questions.

Grading scale

[29p, 32p] 5
[26p, 29p) 4,5
[23p, 26p) 4
[20p, 23p) 3,5
[16p, 20p) 3

This proposition of the grade will be your tutorial grade iff You will get at least 5 points (out of 30 points)   in your  first attempt at the  exam.

Otherwise the proposition of the grade is not valid and your tutorial grade is 2.
